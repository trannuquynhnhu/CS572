1. Sometimes, we want to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout because:
- setImmediate is similar to setTimeout(_, 0) which means the callback function will be put into the queues immediately, 
but setTimeout callback function will be put at the Timer phase while the setImmediate callback function will be put at the Check phase
of the queue.
- As the result, the setImmediate will be executed faster than setTimeout.

2. Explain the difference between setImmediate and process.nextTick
- setImmediate put the callback function into the queue while process.nextTick put the callback function to another priority queue (called
nextTick queue) and all the tasks in the nextTick queue will be executed right after the current operation is completed and before the tasks 
in the 'normal' queue are executed. 
- As the result, process.nextTick will be executed before setImmediate

3. Name 10 global modules available in Node environment:

- https: to make Nodejs act as a HTTPS server
- net: to create server and client
- os: provides information about operating System
- path: to handle file paths
- stream: to handle stream data
